# Example Git Exercise 1

## Running the exercise 

1. Clone or fork this repository
2. Within a console, change to the repository 
3. Run `java -jar gitruler.jar`, you should see all of the tests failing, for now.
4. Complete the exercise below, running `java -jar gitruler.jar` occasionally to check your progress. When you get a green tick next to each rule, you've succeeded!

## Exercise

**Learning Outcomes:** To complete this exercise you will need to be able to: Move a file using git and Create a new file and add it to your git repository.

1. Use git to move `test1.txt` into `folder`. Commit that change.
2. Create a new folder within the repository's root called `another-folder`
3. Create a new file called `text2.txt` within `another-folder`. Commit that change.

If you've done that successfully all tests should pass when running `java -jar gitruler.jar`.
